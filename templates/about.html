        <p> These pages provide a log of the #fah irc channel, which is
        used for testing new Folding@Home projects. </p>

        <p> Logs are generated with irssi. A cron job checks every hour if
        the irssi process has died and tries to restart it. A cron job uses
        a small python script to render the log files into html and copy
        the results to a webserver every 15 minutes. </p>

        <p> The code for this can be found <a
            href="https://github.com/mpharrigan/fah-irc-log">on Github</a>.
        Pull requests are welcome to improve the html rendering.  </p>
